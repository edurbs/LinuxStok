# LinuxStok
Old project from 2006 that was hosted only on [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxstok/). It was made with PHP 5 and PHP-GTK2.<br>
Download the [Windows version](https://github.com/edurbs/LinuxStok/releases/download/0.8/linuxstok-code-r103.zip) and run it to go back to the past ;)<br>
